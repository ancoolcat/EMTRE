The source codes for the IJCAI-24 paper titled "Enhancing Evolutionary Multitasking for High-Dimensional Feature Selection Through Task Relevance Evaluation and Knowledge Transfer" (EMTRE framework) can be accessed. 

The codes implements the innovative approach presented in the paper, aiming to improve evolutionary multitasking for high-dimensional feature selection by evaluating task relevance and effectively transferring knowledge between tasks.

The codes are run from "run_EMTRE.py".
